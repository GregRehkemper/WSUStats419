This is an [R Markdown](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com) Notebook. When you execute code within the notebook, the results appear beneath the code. 

Try executing this chunk by clicking the *Run* button within the chunk or by placing your cursor inside it and pressing *Ctrl+Shift+Enter*. 

```{r Instructions}
install.packages("plotrix")
install.packages("pracma")
# (1) Write a handshake function:
# 
# # git r done #
# 
# handShake = function(n=1, plotMe=FALSE)
#   {
#   
#   
#   }
# 
# (2) Write code that reads in the "original draft [draft.txt]" of the declaration of independence (the Thomas Jefferson draft).  Write code that reads in the "unanimous draft [final.txt]" (signed by Congress).  [You will have to find this data on your own.  'Big Brother' Google will likely help.] For each draft, count how many letters of the alphabet used.  (lower case a-z and OTHER as the bucket for any non-white space symbol).  Write a generic function [create a very verbose name] that does this where the input is the raw string and the output is a dataframe that has one row with a-z,OTHER as the column names and the counts of the each character in the cell.  Summarize these results as a table and as "one visualization".  
# 
# EASTER EGG (10 points): post code that would take the two text inputs (original.string and final.string) and perform a string diff comparison.
# 
# 
# (4) Write a function "computeDeterminant" for a 3x3 matrix.  The function take a 3x3 matrix as the input and "manually" loop through and compute the Determinant.
# 
# 
# # DELIVERABLE:  Create a RStudio "intro.Rmd" ... notebook [VERBOSE ... descriptive] ... functions-intro.R ... github (notebook) ... 
# 
# Create a folder in your github/datasets/ called "declaration" and therein, include "draft.txt" and "final.txt" and "_README_.txt" where the last file has some basic information about where the data was found, and when (e.g., on this data, this URL)
```

Add a new chunk by clicking the *Insert Chunk* button on the toolbar or by pressing *Ctrl+Alt+I*.

When you save the notebook, an HTML file containing the code and output will be saved alongside it (click the *Preview* button or press *Ctrl+Shift+K* to preview the HTML file).

The preview shows you a rendered HTML copy of the contents of the editor. Consequently, unlike *Knit*, *Preview* does not run any R code chunks. Instead, the output of the chunk when it was last run in the editor is displayed.

}

#unable to get arc to run, kept getting errors when plotting in range for x. tried to find online help, but couldn't get any instructions or advice. I'm thinking the problem was in pulling the package from github, like the system couldn't find it. I don't know, but this would be perfect. It's no longer time effective to work on this for this assignment.   
    
#  #create an arc graph with 'n' nodes
#   HSGraph = graph.h(n,mode = "out")
#   # add names to nodes
# V(HSGraph)$name = paste("person", 1:vcount(HSGraph), sep = "-")
# # extract edgelist
# HSEdges = get.edgelist(HSGraph)
# # plot arc diagram
# arcplot(HSEdges, las = 1)
