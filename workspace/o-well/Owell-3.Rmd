```###  ASSIGNMENT (3) ###

Review the data, and other students' questions, and copy 'oWell-2.Rmd' to 'oWell-3.Rmd' and make changes to this third notebook.

I would add the data for "distance from the salty Red Sea/Gulf"
I would add the data for the Wilcox classification ... 'Wilcox.C' and 'Wilcox.S'
```{r}
#I want to compare the purity of the water to the altitude. To do this, I will look into the TDS (Total Desolve solvents) and compare that to the altitude of the well. 
require(ggplot2)
rawTable$fault

TDStoAltPlot <- qplot (rawTable$TDS, rawTable$altitude.ft, xlab = "TDS", ylab = "Altitude", col =rawTable$geology) 

print (TDStoAltPlot + ggtitle("TDS TO ALTITUDE"))

#########OBSERVATION###########
# This plot Shows that the Sand has lower TDS in the wells, and they tend to be in lower altitudes. The geom didn't want to use integers to relabel the points, despite specifying they are integers. This may have needed a reset of the program to fix. The error code that was coming up is not listed in the system and could not be found by google.
```


```{r}
ironToPhosphatesPlot <- qplot (rawTable$Fe, rawTable$PO4, xlab = "Iron", ylab = "Phosphates", col =rawTable$fault)

print (ironToPhosphatesPlot + ggtitle("Iron To Phosphates"))

####OBSERVATION####
#Despite an outlier sharing a high level of both phosphates and iron, there doesn't look to be any direct correlation between the 2. Both Iron and Phosphates were found at all distances from Faults lines.

```


```{r}
#Not the direction I wanted to go with this, Scrapped this idea when I found out what TDS stood for
#x =rowSums(rawTable[,2:23])

#meanX <- (x/22)
#meanX

#Not the direction I wanted to go with this
#normalizedX <- (x - meanX)
#normalizedX

#cosX <- cos(normalizedX)
#cosX

#y <- cos(rawTable$altitude.ft)
#y

#s = seq(-1, 1, 100)
#s
#sumofRaw <- rowSums(rawTable[,2:23])
#sumofRaw

```
